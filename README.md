# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

- This project is a short story on the history of Pluto. I wanted to create something that was entertaining, educational, and simple at the same time so it can be understood and enjoyed by as much people as possible. Through the webpages, I use interactive images which can move and make sounds so the user can be entertained by some funny visuals and sounds, all while learning about Pluto at a quick pace. It goes through the formation of Pluto, the history of its discovery and time as a planet, its demotion to being a dwarf planet, and finally it gives Pluto a real happy ending despite that set back.

## Figma Design

- https://www.figma.com/design/0lxzz2m7pbBTvrNgaUxOyQ/A-Pluto-Story?node-id=0-1&t=V20n5w43JUWaUZXY-1 
- For the design, I mainly wanted to create a similar layout like regular story books do with the picture at the top and the text at the bottom. I also wanted the pages with the story to be black, both for the space theme and for more negative space for the story assets.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Percentages and CSS methods such as flex and object-fit are used to make sure that elements don't spill outside the viewing screen and scale accurately across various screen dimensions.
- **Animations**: Animations are played when clicking on images using GSAP, same goes for transitions.
- **User-triggered Events**: Animations, sound effects, and transitions are all triggered by clicking on images and buttons.
- **Sound Effects**: Triggered via clicking on images and picked out for moments that make sense in the story. They are mainly meant for entertainment though so it's subjective.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages Used**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Libraries Used**: GSAP
- **OTHER**: GitHub Pages (hosting), Figma (designing)

## Live Demo

## Credits
- Sound effects used are from the videogames Deltarune, Undertale, and Omori (only on page 4). NOTE: The first two games share the same sound effects for the most part.
- Story assets used are made by me using Aseprite.

## Future Enhancements

- Would definitely want to add music or a toggle for music to be played.
- Would also wamt to create a seamless experience rather than having to change between pages with various html files.
